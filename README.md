# totalitycorp-frontend-challenge


1. This website is purely made by HTML, Scss and Javascript without any linraries.
2. While making the website the goals and objective points are taken care of.
3. Made the website responsive so its easier to view in mobile.
4. Used flexbox and grid for layout.
5. This can be viewed directly from github pages so I haven't hosted it anywhere.
